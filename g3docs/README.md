## Project Description
We intend to tackle illegal activities in forest like poaching,trespassing by deploying state-of-the-art techniques in object detection and localisation,activity recognition and netwroking between cameras.Thermal cameras used for greater range and night vision as well as to detect through camouflage.

We are yet to implement Animal detection because of sparsity of data
